"cPanel has not only revolutionized my entire hosting business but has also drastically reduced the rate of support requests from our customers and has overall simplified the interface in which our users see and use everyday.

You've made my life easier and have given me the ability to focus on growing my business. <strong>Mark Mutti - Phirefast.com</strong>",
"Excellent, extremely precise instructions solved the issue in a matter of minutes, despite my lack of knowledge of most of the technical stuff and almost no experience working with a SSH and Telnet connection. <strong>Aldo Chattah</strong>",
"Superbly. He not only identified what was wrong with our server config, but provided instructions as to how we can avoid this with new server installs in the future. <strong>Joshua Smith - iOnline</strong>",
"Mike responded sooner than I had actually expected and with a solution right away to an issue that genuinely required some digging. He followed up twice with specific details and even resolved another related concern, all in a relatively short time span. This after my own license vendor had required additional support fees to even look at the issue.<strong>HostMaster at Web1Host</strong>",
"Quick Response (within seconds), Quick resolution (within 1 minute) Friendly. I was a victim of excellent service, how often can one say that with honesty ?! Cpanel is very lucky to have his expertise at their disposal, and I am so glad he picked up my query. <strong>Winston Langley</strong> ",
